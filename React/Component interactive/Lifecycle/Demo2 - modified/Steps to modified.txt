You are so sick of having to type exclamation points! You have to hold down the shift key, and then reach up with your pinkie... ugh. The worst.

You've written a program to type your exclamation points for you. Select Enthused.js and take a look at your source code.

On lines 6-10, Enthused contains a componentDidMount method that calls a setInterval function, which adds an exclamation point to some text every 15ms.

Enthused renders a 'Stop!' button. Clicking 'Stop!' will unmount the Enthused component and stop the exclamation points.

Open App.js. App renders an <h1></h1>, a text entry field, and a button. At first, this button says 'Add Enthusiasm!' Clicking on this button will remove it and replace it with an <Enthused /> instance. Clicking on <Enthused />'s "Stop!" button will remove <Enthused /> and replace it with the first button.

Click Run. Let the browser refresh.

If this is your first time through this checkpoint, then try entering some text. Click on the button for auto-enthusiasm.

AAAAAH! The Stop button doesn't work! Too much enthusiasm forever!!!!

Hit cmd-R to refresh the page.

Select Enthused.js.

Give Enthused a new componentWillUnmount function, that will stop the madness whenever Enthused is unmounted:

componentWillUnmount: function (prevProps, prevState) {
  clearInterval(this.interval);
},

Try entering some text, and then adding some more enthusiasm. This time the Stop button should work!

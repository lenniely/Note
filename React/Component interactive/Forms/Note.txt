This unit's final lesson is about forms.

Think about how forms work in a typical, non-React environment. A user types some data into a form's input fields, and the server doesn't know about it. The server remains clueless until the user hits a "submit" button, which sends all of the form's data over to the server simultaneously.

In React, as in many other JavaScript environments, this is not the best way of doing things.

The problem is the period of time during which a form thinks that a user has typed one thing, but the server thinks that the user has typed a different thing. What if, during that time, a third part of the website needs to know what a user has typed? It could ask the form or the server and get two different answers. In a complex JavaScript app with many moving, interdependent parts, this kind of conflict can easily lead to problems.

In a React form, you want the server to know about every new character or deletion, as soon as it happens. That way, your screen will always be in sync with the rest of your application.

There are two terms that will probably come up when you talk about React forms: controlled component and uncontrolled component. Like automatic binding, controlled vs uncontrolled components is a topic that you should be familiar with, but don't need to understand deeply at this point.

An uncontrolled component is a component that maintains its own internal state. A controlled component is a component that does not maintain any internal state. Since a controlled component has no state, it must be controlled by someone else.

Think of a typical <input type='text' /> element. It appears onscreen as a text box. If you need to know what text is currently in the box, then you can ask the <input />, possibly with some code like this:

var input = document.querySelector('input[type="text"]');

var typedText = input.value; // input.value will be equal to whatever text is currently in the text box.

The important thing here is that the <input /> keeps track of its own text. You can ask it what its text is at any time, and it will be able to tell you.

The fact that <input /> keeps track of information makes it an uncontrolled component. It maintains its own internal state, by remembering data about itself.

A controlled component, on the other hand, has no memory. If you ask it for information about itself, then it will have to get that information through props. Most React components are controlled.

In React, when you give an <input /> a value attribute, then something strange happens: the <input /> BECOMES controlled. It stops using its internal storage. This is a more 'React' way of doing things.

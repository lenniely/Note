Separating container components from presentational components is a popular React programming pattern.

Here's the basic idea behind it: if a component has to have state, make calculations based on props, or manage any other complex logic, then that component shouldn't also have to render HTML-like JSX.

Instead of rendering HTML-like JSX, the component should render another component. It should be that component's job to render HTML-like JSX.

Following this pattern separates your business logic from your presentational logic, which is a Good Thing.

When you separate a container component from a presentational component, the presentational component will always end up like this: one render function, and no other properties.

If you have a component class with nothing but a render function, then you can rewrite that component class in a very different way. Instead of using React.createClass, you can write it as JavaScript function!

A component class written as a function is called a stateless functional component. Stateless functional components have some advantages over typical component classes. We'll cover those advantages in this lesson.

// A component class written in the usual way:
var MyComponentClass = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
});

// The same component class, written as a stateless functional component:
function MyComponentClass () {
  return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
}

// Works the same either way:
ReactDOM.render(
	<MyComponentClass />,
	document.getElementById('app')
);

------------------------------------------------------------------

Stateless functional components usually have props passed to them.

To access these props, give your stateless functional component a parameter. This parameter will automatically be equal to the component's props object.

Not only are stateless functional components more concise, but they will subtly influence how you think about components in a positive way. They emphasize the fact that components are basically functions! A component takes two optional inputs, props and state, and outputs HTML and/or other components.


// Normal way to display a prop:
var MyComponentClass = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>;
  }
});

// Stateless functional component way to display a prop:
function MyComponentClass (props) {
  return <h1>{props.title}</h1>;
}

// Normal way to display a prop using a variable:
var MyComponentClass = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
  	var title = this.props.title;
    return <h1>{title}</h1>;
  }
});

// Stateless functional component way to display a prop using a variable:
function MyComponentClass (props) {
	var title = props.title;
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}

var React = require('react');
function GuineaPigs(props){
  var src= props.src;
  return (
      <div>
        <h1>Cute Guinea Pigs</h1>
        <img src={src} />
      </div>
    ); 
}
module.exports = GuineaPigs;
